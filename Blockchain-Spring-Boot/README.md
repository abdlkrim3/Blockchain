# Blockchain Workshop

This workshop provides a practical guide to understanding and building a blockchain from scratch using Java and Spring Boot. It covers the core concepts of blockchain technology, step-by-step implementation of blockchain components, and additional features that enhance the functionality of the blockchain application.

## Workshop Objectives

The objectives of this workshop are as follows:
- Provide a clear understanding of the core concepts of blockchain technology.
- Guide participants through the step-by-step process of building a blockchain using Java and Spring Boot.
- Familiarize participants with key components such as blocks, transactions, mining, validation mechanisms, and more.
- Explore additional features such as consensus mechanisms, peer-to-peer networking, wallet management, and smart contracts.
- Emphasize the importance of testing, security considerations, and validation mechanisms in blockchain implementation.

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of blockchain implementation. Here's an overview of the sections covered:

1. Introduction
    - Overview of blockchain technology and its potential impact on various industries.

2. Blockchain Components
    - Block Class: Implementing the Block class to represent individual blocks in the blockchain.
    - Blockchain Class: Managing the list of blocks and ensuring the integrity of the chain.
    - Hashing Function: Implementing a cryptographic hashing function for block hashes.

3. Transaction Pool
    - Transaction Class: Defining the Transaction class to represent individual transactions.
    - Transaction Pool Class: Managing pending transactions before inclusion in blocks.

4. Additional Features
    - Peer-to-Peer Networking: Implementing P2P networking for node communication and message propagation.
    - Wallet Management: Implementing wallet functionality for secure storage and transaction interaction.
    - Smart Contracts: Integrating smart contracts for self-executing agreements with predefined conditions.
    - Consensus Mechanisms: Exploring different consensus mechanisms for achieving distributed consensus.
    - Testing and Security Considerations: Highlighting the importance of testing and security in blockchain development.

5. Block Validation
    - Implementing validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and security of individual blocks.

6. Proof of Work Implementation
    - Implementing the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm for mining new blocks.

7. Additional Resources
    - Providing additional resources, references, and further readings for participants to continue their blockchain learning journey.
